This is an design project created by Tomo Lazovich with some help from Anthropic's Claude (ironically). It is a reflection of how facial recognition can dehumanize its subjects. The overlay on the faces is a real [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) run in conjunction with the [Haar cascade](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html) detection algorithm. The race, gender, and emotion scores are also the outputs of real models, computed with tools from the [deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) package. The other scores are not the outputs of real models, but they definitely could be. See for example [this](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41188560) or [this](https://www.wired.com/story/algorithm-predicts-criminality-based-face-sparks-furor/).
